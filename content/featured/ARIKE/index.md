ARIKE is a centralized palliative care management system developed to support terminally ill patients through structured home-based care. As part of the core development team, I contributed to building the Patient Management module, which captured key details like personal information, family background, and disease history. I helped in designing the database schema and implement critical forms and workflows to streamline patient onboarding and tracking.
