CARE is an open-source patient management system by the CoronaSafe Network, built to support critical workflows like triage and ICU monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. I enhanced the platform by implementing a browser-based file viewer, allowing doctors to preview patient files (PDFs, images, videos, etc.) without downloading them. I also developed an interactive Pressure Sore assessment tool using the Braden Scale, enabling intuitive data entry through clickable body diagrams.
