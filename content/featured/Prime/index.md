Built a fully functional Amazon Prime Video clone using ReactJS, Firebase, and TMDB APIâ€”one of the few original, complete clones not based on any tutorial. Unlike typical one-page clones, this project replicates multiple core features including dynamic movie listings, and video previews. It was featured on platforms like Dev.to and Gourav.io Clone Wars, and gained significant traction with views and forks on GitHub.
